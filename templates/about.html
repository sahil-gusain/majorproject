<h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The brain tumor and its analysis are of extraordinary interest because of the developing innovation in medical image processing. As indicated by the overview led by the National Brain Tumor Foundation (NBTF), the improvement of brain tumor diagnosis among patients and the death rate due to brain tumors is succeeding earlier year’s insights across the globe [1,2]. The latest advances in machine learning (especially deep learning) help identify, classify, and measure patterns in medical images. 
    The core of these developments is by using hierarchical feature representations learned only from data rather than manually designed features based on specific domain knowledge. Likewise, a few works have proposed frameworks or models to feature the brain tumor zone in recent years, which might be trailed by stages such as outcome predictions, classification, and treatment planning. Brain tumor segmentation in medical image processing is necessary and generally governed by factors such as missing boundaries,
    noise, and low contrast. MRI segmentation using learning strategies and pattern recognition technology is very successful in analyzing brain images. Technically speaking, the method is a parametric model that considers the functions selected based on the density function [3]. Early screening of such brain tumors issues is crucial to encourage convenient therapy and sound living with contemporary clinical imaging modalities. The most common modalities that are utilized to analyze the tumor in the brain are positron 
    emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) [2].

    Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-known medical device used to diagnose and analyze many diseases such as brain tumors, neurological diseases, epilepsy, etc. Usually, a system completely processed by hardware/computer helps automate this process to obtain accurate and fast results. On the other hand, image segmentation is the main task of various computer vision and image processing implementations. The hypothesis of the hash process divides the image into different areas according to some measures for further processing .
     Detection of brain abnormalities is usually done manually using MRI imaging by medical experts. The large-scale manual examination method can often lead to misinterpretation due to some factors such as fatigue and excessive abundance of MRI slices. In addition, it is non-repeatable and results in intra- and inter-reader variability. Alleviating these concerns requires developing a detection system method to diagnose various brain abnormalities. It also helps in promoting fast, reliable, and accurate analysis and supports the clinicians in their final selection process
     . Machine learning techniques are mainly used to design and automate systems that have enjoyed spectacular success in recent decades. Many methods (also known as automatic detection of pathological brain systems) have been formulated to classify the brain’s different MRI scans. These diagrams mainly focus on solving two brain types based on MRI classification disorders, namely binary and multiclass. In the binary category, brain MRI scans are classified as either pathological (abnormal) or normal.</p>
